# 🔻 Real-Time Clock Project with ATmega32 Microcontroller

I'm excited to share my first project on LinkedIn, and it certainly won’t be the last! This **Real-Time Clock** was designed and implemented using the ATmega32 microcontroller, showcasing a blend of functionality and user-friendly features.

## 🌟 Key Features

### ✨ Time Setting

- Users can set the time in either **12-hour or 24-hour format**, offering flexibility.

### ✨ Alarm Functionality

- Integrated alarm feature for convenient time-based alerts.

### ✨ Temperature Monitoring

- Displays current temperature, providing real-time environmental feedback.

### ✨ User Interaction

- A keypad interface allows users to set the time, configure alarms, and toggle between modes.

### ✨ Visual Feedback

- Time is displayed on seven-segment displays for easy readability.

### ✨ Invalid Inputs

- Code handles most invalid input scenarios to prevent user errors and enhance reliability.

## 📍 Learning Experience

This project deepened my understanding of **hardware-software integration** within embedded systems and gave me hands-on experience with the ADC, timers, and interrupts.

## Project Structure

### MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer)
